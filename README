REQUIREMENTS
	To use Audiotag, you must have:

	1. Perl >= 5.6
	2. At least one of...
	   - id3tag and id3info (from id3lib, id3lib.sourceforge.net) in $PATH
	   - vorbiscomment (from vorbis-tools, xiph.org/ogg/vorbis) in $PATH
	   - metaflac (from flac, flac.sourceforge.net) in $PATH

INSTALL
	Just copy `audiotag' to /usr/local/bin (or somewhere in $PATH)

USAGE
	% audiotag [OPTION]... [FILE]...

	tip: Use the -p option before running it for real!

	Examples:

	Set GENRE to "Metal"
	% audiotag -g Metal *.mp3 *.ogg

	Guess and set TRACKNUM - guess track uses the simple pattern '(\d\d)\.'
	% audiotag -G *.mp3 *.ogg

	Set TITLE based on a pattern match of the filename - This example would
	work for files with a name in the form "Mudvayne - 01. Shadow of a Man.ogg"
	% audiotag --title-pattern '.*?\d\d\. (.*?)\.ogg' *.ogg

	Same as above, but don't really do anything, just see what it WOULD do
	% audiotag --pretend --title-pattern '.*?\d\d\. (.*?)\.ogg' *.ogg

BUGS
	doesn't handle symlinks
	comment field support isn't fully functional for MP3s
