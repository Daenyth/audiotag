To use audiotag, you must have:

1. vorbiscomment (from vorbis-tools) in your path
2. id3tag & id3info (from id3lib) in your path
3. Perl >= 5.6

INSTALL

Just copy `audiotag' to /usr/local/bin (or somewhere in your path)

USAGE

% audiotag [OPTION]... [FILE]...

Examples:

Set GENRE to "Metal"
% audiotag -g Metal *.mp3 *.ogg

Guess and set TRACKNUM - guess track uses the simple pattern '(\d\d)\.'
% audiotag -G *.mp3 *.ogg

Set TITLE based on a pattern match of the filename - This example would work
for files with a name in the form "Mudvayne - 01. Shadow of a Man.ogg"
% audiotag --title-pattern '.*?\d\d\. (.*?)\.ogg' *.ogg

Same as above, but don't really do anything, just see what it WOULD do
% audiotag --pretend --title-pattern '.*?\d\d\. (.*?)\.ogg' *.ogg

BUGS

None!

No, I'm kidding.  audiotag requires more testing, and it currently doesn't
handle failed pattern matches in any way at all.  Avoid that with the -p option
before running it for real.
